  <p style="white-space: nowrap;">This paragraph is not allowed to wrap,
    which means that the only way to end a line is to insert a line-break
    element. If no such element is inserted, then the line will go forever,
    forcing the user to scroll horizontally to read whatever can't be
    initially displayed <br />in the browser window.</p>
