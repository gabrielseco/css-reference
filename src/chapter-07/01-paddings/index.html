    <p>
      This paragraph is contained within a DIV that has a width of 600 pixels, so its padding will be 10% of the width
      of the paragraph's parent element. Given the declared width of 600 pixels, the padding will be 60 pixels on all
      sides.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div style="width: 300px;">
    <p>
      This paragraph is contained within a DIV with a width of 300 pixels, so its padding will still be 10% of the
      width of the paragraph's parent. There will, therefore, be half as much padding on this paragraph as that on the
      first paragraph.
